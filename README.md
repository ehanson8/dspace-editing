# dspace-editing

**This repository has been archived and has been merged in https://github.com/ehanson8/dspace-api. All further development will occur in that repository and not further updates will happen here**

**Note**: Upgraded to Python 3 in 02/2019. The Python 2.x version can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ehanson8/dspace-editing/releases)

**Note**: These scripts were updated in 05/2018 for the new authentication method used by DSpace 6.x

All of these scripts require a secrets.py file in the same directory that must contain the following text:
```
        baseURL='https://dspace.myuni.edu'
        email='dspace_user@.myuni.edu'
        password='my_dspace_password'    
        filePath = '/Users/dspace_user/dspace-data-collection/data/'
        handlePrefix = 'http://dspace.myuni.edu/handle/'
        verify = True or False (no quotes). Use False if using an SSH tunnel to connect to the DSpace API
        skippedCollections = A list of the 'uuid' of any collections that you wish the script to skip. (e.g. ['45794375-6640-4efe-848e-082e60bae375'])
```
The 'filePath' is directory into which output files will be written and 'handlePrefix' may or may not vary from your DSpace URL depending on your configuration. This secrets.py file will be ignored according to the repository's .gitignore file so that DSpace login details will not be inadvertently exposed through GitHub.

If you are using both a development server and a production server, you can create a separate secrets.py file with a different name (e.g. secretsProd.py) and containing the production server information. When running each of these scripts, you will be prompted to enter the file name (e.g 'secretsProd' without '.py') of an alternate secrets file. If you skip the prompt or incorrectly type the file name, the scripts will default to the information in the secrets.py file. This ensures that you will only edit the production server if you really intend to.

#### [addKeyValuePairOnHandleCSV.py](addKeyValuePairOnHandleCSV.py)
Based on user input, adds key-value pairs from a specified CSV file of DSpace item handles and the value to be added to that item using the specified key. A CSV log is written with all of the changes made and a 'dc.description.provenance' note describing the change is added to the metadata of each item that is updated.

#### [addKeyValuePairToCollection.py](addKeyValuePairToCollection.py)
Based on user input, adds a specified key-value pair with a specified language value to every item in the collection with the specified handle.

#### [addKeyValuePairToCommunity.py](addKeyValuePairToCommunity.py)
Based on user input, adds a specified key-value pair with a specified language value to every item in every collection in the community with the specified handle.

#### [addNewItemsToCollection.py](addNewItemsToCollection.py)
Based on user input, adds new items to the specified collection. In the specified directory, the script creates items and associated metadata based on a 'metadataNewFiles.json' file in the directory. The script then posts files for the appropriate items, which is determined by having the file name (minus the file extension) in a 'dc.identifier.other' field in the item metadata record.

#### [createItemMetadataFromCSV.py](createItemMetadataFromCSV.py)
Based on user input, creates a JSON file of metadata that can be added to a DSpace item from the specified CSV file or from values directly specified in the script. The 'createMetadataElementCSV' function in the script is used to create a metadata element from the specified CSV file and has three variables:

- 'key' - The Dublin Core property to be used for the element.
- 'value' - The column in the specified CSV file that contains the data for the element.
- 'language' - The desired language value for the element

The 'createMetadataElementDirect' function in the script is used to create a metadata element without a CSV file (intended for metadata elements that will be constant across all items in a collection) and has three variables:

- 'key' - The Dublin Core property to be used for the element.
- 'value' - The actual value of the element.
- 'language' - The desired language value for the element.

#### [deleteBitstreamsFromItem.py](deleteBitstreamsFromItem.py)
Based on user input, removes all bitstreams associated with an item with the specified handle.

#### [deleteKeyFromCollection.py](deleteKeyFromCollection.py)
Based on user input, removes all key-value pairs with the specified key for every item in the collection with the specified handle.

#### [deleteKeyFromCommunity.py](deleteKeyFromCommunity.py)
Based on user input, removes all key-value pairs with the specified key for every item in every collection in the community with the specified handle.

#### [deleteKeyValuePairFromCollection.py](deleteKeyValuePairFromCollection.py)
Based on user input, removes all key-value pairs with the specified key and value for every item in the collection with the specified handle.

#### [editBitstreamsNames.py](editBitstreamsNames.py)
Based on a specified CSV file of DSpace item handles and replacement file names, replaces the name of bitstreams attached to the specified items.

#### [generateCollectionLevelAbstract.py](generateCollectionLevelAbstract.py)
Based on user input, creates an HTML collection-level abstract that contains hyperlinks to all of the items in each series, as found in the metadata CSV. This assumes that the series title is recorded in 'dc.relation.ispartof' or a similar property in the DSpace item records. The abstract is then posted to the collection in DSpace.

#### [overwriteExistingMetadata.py](overwriteExistingMetadata.py)
Based on a specified CSV file of DSpace item handles and file identifiers, replaces the metadata of the items with specified handles with the set of metadata elements associated with the corresponding file identifier in a JSON file of metadata entries named 'metadataOverwrite.json.'

#### [postCollection.py](postCollection.py)
Based on user input, creates a collection with a specified name within the specified community. In the specified directory, the script creates items and associated metadata based on a 'collectionMetadata.json' file in the directory. Based on the specified file extension, the script then posts each file in the directory  with that extension as a bitstream for the appropriate item, which is determined by having the file name (minus the file extension) in a 'dc.identifier.other' field in the item metadata record.

#### [removeDuplicateKeyValuePairsFromItems.py](removeDuplicateKeyValuePairsFromItems.py)
Finds all items with duplicate key-value pairs and removes the duplicates. A CSV log is written with all of the changes made and a 'dc.description.provenance' note describing the change is added to the metadata of each item that is updated.

#### [replaceKey.py](replaceKey.py)
Based on user input, replaces one specified key with another specified key in all item metadata across the repository. A CSV log is written with all of the changes made and a 'dc.description.provenance' note describing the change is added to the metadata of each item that is updated.

#### [replaceKeyForCollection.py](replaceKeyForCollection.py)
Based on user input, replaces one specified key with another specified key in all item metadata across the specified collection. A CSV log is written with all of the changes made and a 'dc.description.provenance' note describing the change is added to the metadata of each item that is updated.

#### [replaceKeyForCommunity.py](replaceKeyForCommunity.py)
Based on user input, replaces one specified key with another specified key in all item metadata across the specified community. A CSV log is written with all of the changes made and a 'dc.description.provenance' note describing the change is added to the metadata of each item that is updated.

#### [replaceKeyValuePairOnItemIdCSV.py](replaceKeyValuePairOnItemIdCSV.py)
Based on user input, updates key-value pairs on the specified items from the specified CSV file with the columns: 'replacedKey,' 'replacementKey,' 'replacedValue,' 'replacementValue,' and 'itemID.' A CSV log is written with all of the changes made and a 'dc.description.provenance' note describing the change is added to the metadata of each item that is updated.

#### [replaceKeyValuePairsFromCSV.py](replaceKeyValuePairsFromCSV.py)
Based on user input, updates key-value pairs from the specified CSV file with the columns: 'replacedKey,' 'replacementKey,' 'replacedValue,' and 'replacementValue.' A CSV log is written with all of the changes made and a 'dc.description.provenance' note describing the change is added to the metadata of each item that is updated.
